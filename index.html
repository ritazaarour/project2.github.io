        <h2>Proposition: Arab Countries are Economically Dependent on Oil Production </h2>

        <h3>FOR the proposition</h3>

        <figure>
            <img src="images/FOR.png">
            <figcaption><strong><em>Figure 1:</strong></em> Oil Rents by % of GDP in comparison to Total Natural Resource Rents by % of GDP per country. </figcaption>
        </figure>
        <p>Design Decisions and Rational</p>
        <ul>
            <li>A bar chart for easy viewing to display the Oil Rents for each country and a shaded reference line to display the total amount of Natural Resource Rents for each country </li>
            <li>Sorted in descending order by Oil Rents so the chart is easier to look at</li>
            <li>Coloring oil bars orange draws attention to oil's dominance to encourage viewers to interpret oil as central</li>
         </ul>

        <h3>AGAINST the proposition</h3>

        <figure>
            <img src="images/AGAINST.png">
            <figcaption><strong><em>Figure 2:</strong></em> Oil Rents vs Non-Oil Rents by % of GDP for each country. </figcaption>

        <p>Design Decisions and Rational</p>
        <ul>
            <li>A stacked bar chart to show the proportions of Oil Rents vs Non-Oil Rents to show that oil does not make up their total GDP</li>
            <li>Sorted in descending order by Oil Rents so the chart is easier to look at</li>
            <li>Highlighting oil to be the same color as Figure 1 so viewers can easily make the comparison</li>
        </ul>

        <h2>Final Reflection</h2>
        <p class="FR">Figure 1 shows oil rents as a percentage of GDP for Arab countries, with a reference line marking total natural resource rents. Oil rents refer to the economic profit a country earns from extracting and selling crude oil expressed as a percentage of what makes up their GDP. Total natural resource rents include profits from all major extractive sectors such as coal, forests, minerals, natural gas, and oil, also expressed as a percentage of GDP. Together, these metrics measure how much of a country’s economy depends on resource extraction. Because the oil bars in Figure 1 approach or nearly match the total rents line in most cases, the chart emphasizes that oil constitutes the majority of resource-based income. This perspective positions the viewer to interpret that Arab economies as deeply tied to oil extraction and emphasizing the idea of economic dependence.<br>
            
            However, Figure 2 challenges that proposition by comparing oil rents to total GDP. This was done simply by subtracting Oil Rents from 100 to create a new field of Non-Oil Rents. When oil rents are placed alongside the remaining share of GDP, it becomes clear that even countries with high oil levels, such as Kuwait, still generate a significant portion of their economy from non-oil sources. For example, Kuwait’s oil rents make up just under half of its total GDP, meaning more than half of its economy stems from other sectors. This perspective weakens the earlier assumption of total dependence by showing that Arab economies possess additional economic activity beyond oil production.<br>   
            
            This project showed me how much design choices can shape interpretation. In Figure 1, isolating oil against total natural resource rents made Arab economies appear almost entirely oil-based, while Figure 2 reframed the same data to reveal that other sectors contribute to total GDP. This taught me that data can support multiple narratives depending on how it is framed. As a result, I now view ethical visualization as the responsible use of perspective and guiding the viewer toward an interpretation without hiding context or distorting scale. Ethical persuasion does not avoid emphasis, but it ensures that the emphasis remains truthful and allows room for alternative understanding.
