        <h2>Proposition: Oil Dependence in Arab Countries Makes Their Economies Vulnerable</h2>

        <h3>FOR the proposition</h3>

        <figure>
            <img src="images/FOR.png">
            <figcaption><strong><em>Figure 1:</strong></em> A display of how much Oil Rents by % of GDP make up the Total Natural Resource Rents by % of GDP for each country. </figcaption>
        </figure>
        <p>Design Decisions and Rational</p>
        <ul>
            <li>A bar chart for easy viewing to display the Oil Rents for each country and a shaded reference line to display the total amount of Natural Resource Rents for each country. </li>
            <li>Sorted in descending order by Oil Rents so the chart is easier to look at.</li>
            <li>Reason 3</li>
         </ul>

        <h3>AGAINST the proposition</h3>

        <figure>
            <img src="images/AGAINST.png">
            <figcaption><strong><em>Figure 2:</strong></em> A stacked bar chart to display the proportions of Oil Rents vs Non-Oil Rents by % of GDP for each country. </figcaption>
        </figure>
        <p>Design Decisions and Rational</p>
        <ul>
            <li>A stacked bar chart to show the proportions of Oil Rents vs Non-Oil Rents to show that oil does not make up their total GDP</li>
            <li>Sorted in descending order by Oil Rents so the chart is easier to look at.</li>
            <li>Reason 3</li>
        </ul>
